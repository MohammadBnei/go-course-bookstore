**Course Title:** "Building a Bookstore with Go"

**Module 1: Introduction and Setup**

* **Objective:** Set up the development environment and create a basic Go web server.
* **Project Enhancement:** 
  * Initialize the "Bookstore" project.
  * Set up a basic web server using the `net/http` package.
  * Display a "Welcome to Bookstore" page.

**Module 2: Templ HTML Tutorial**

* **Objective:** Learn conditions and loops with [Templ](https://templ.guide/) to render dynamic HTML content.
* **Project Enhancement:**
  * Implement HTML templates to display a book.
  * Create a basic layout template for consistent styling.
  * Add a navigation bar to the application.

**Module 3: Working with Data in Go**

* **Objective:** Understand Go's data structures and how to manage data.
* **Project Enhancement:**
  * Define a `Book` struct to represent book data.
  * Load book data from a JSON file.
  * Display detailed book information on individual pages.

**Module 4: Functions, Interfaces and Modules**

* **Objective:** Write reusable functions and manage dependencies with Go modules.
* **Project Enhancement:**
  * Create functions for common tasks like searching and filtering books.
  * Organize code into packages for better modularity.
  * Use a third-party library to enhance functionality (e.g., UUID generation).

**Module 5: Error Handling and Logging**

* **Objective:** Implement robust error handling and logging practices.
* **Project Enhancement:**
  * Add error handling for data loading and user interactions.
  * Use the `log` package to log server events and errors.
  * Display user-friendly error messages on the UI.

**Module 6: File Input/Output and Persistence**

* **Objective:** Work with file I/O and introduce data persistence.
* **Project Enhancement:**
  * Implement file reading and writing for book data.
  * Integrate a database (e.g., SQLite) to store book and user data.
  * Add a "Cart" feature to allow users to add books for purchase.

**Module 7: Networking and HTTP**

* **Objective:** Build RESTful API endpoints and handle HTTP requests.
* **Project Enhancement:**
  * Create API endpoints for book search and purchase operations.
  * Use JSON encoding/decoding for API communication.
  * Implement basic authentication for secure transactions.

**Module 8: Advanced Topics and Best Practices**

* **Objective:** Explore advanced Go features and best practices.
* **Project Enhancement:**
  * Introduce concurrency with goroutines for handling multiple requests.
  * Implement unit tests to ensure code reliability.
  * Use a linting tool to enforce coding standards and best practices.

**Final Project:**

* **Objective:** Integrate all learned concepts into a polished application.
* **Project Enhancement:**
  * Refine the UI and UX for a better user experience.
  * Optimize the application for performance and scalability.
  * Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
